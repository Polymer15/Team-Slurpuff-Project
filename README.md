###Simple Git Usage
Hey guys, just in case you get stuck with git here is an overview of a few common git commands that you will certainly use.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `git clone {repo URL}` | Will clone a repo to your machine |
| `git add -A` | Will add all modified files into the 'stage', if you want to commit changes you must do this before or it wont commit anything |
| `git status` | Will show you the status of the files in the current stage, ie - any added, modified or removed files. Best to check this before any commit |
| `git commit -m '{your message here}'` | This will commit files to the remote repository - be sure to add a descriptive message. If you get a merge conflict and dont know how to fix it, send a message to the group |
| `git remove {file path}` | Will remove a file from the stage, this wont delete the file, it just wont be included in the next commit |
| `git reset {file path}` | Will reset a certain file back to how it was when you first pulled it (ie, will remove your changes!) |
